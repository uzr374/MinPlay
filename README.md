MinPlay is a minimalistic media player which supports virtually all media formats. Based on FFmpeg(media handling), Qt(GUI) and SDL3(video and audio output).

The player implements only basic functionality(simple playlist, seeking, pause/resume, stream switching etc) and utilizes multithreading to ensure better playback experience.
